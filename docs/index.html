<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> - Either Ruby Sass or Libsass.</li>
  <li><a href="http://npmjs.com">NPM</a> or <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> - To pull all of the scales repositories together. Not technically required as you could manually install each repo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Make sure you have the dependencies installed on your system and then, from the root directory of your project, run:</p>

<pre><code>
  npm install --save-dev scalescss
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>
  bower install --save-dev scalescss
</code></pre>

<p>Next you will want to create 3 files (name them whatever you want):</p>

<ol>
  <li>A settings/variables file. ex. <span class="inline-code">_settings.scss</span></li>
  <li>A file to import all of the scales repo. ex. <span class="inline-code">_scales.scss</span></li>
  <li>A main file to import the settings, scales repos, and all of your project partials. ex. <span class="inline-code">styles.scss</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>Settings/Variables</h2>
<p>Scales exposes a large number of variables that allow you to customize nearly everything.</p>

<p>Have a look at all of the [available variables](https://github.com/ScalesCSS/scales/blob/master/vars.md).</p>

<h2>The Scales Repos</h2>
<p>Each piece of Scales is in its own repo. Once you have all of the repos in your project, you will need to import them into a single place. I recommend creating a <span class="inline-code">_scales.scss</span> file that imports everything.</p>

<strong>The order of the imports is very important!</strong>

<p>See an example of the [correct import order](https://github.com/ScalesCSS/scales/blob/master/imports.md).</p>

<h2>Main Sass File</h2>
<p>Once you have these files sorted out, you will want to create a main Scss file that will import your settings, Scales, and the rest of your project partials. This is the file that will get compiled into CSS:</p>

<pre><code>
  @import your-project/settings;
  @import your-project/scales;
  @import your-project/project-partial;
  @import your-project/project-partial;
  @import your-project/project-partial;
  @import your-project/project-partial;
</pre></code>

<h2>Manual Installation</h2>
<p>If you don't want to use a package manager to install Scales, you can clone each repo individually. A full list of repos is in the [imports.md](https://github.com/ScalesCSS/scales/blob/master/imports.md) file. All repos can be found at the [Scales organization page](https://github.com/ScalesCSS) on Github.</p>

<h2>Compile to CSS</h2>
<p>Once you have these things set up you simply need to tell Sass what to compile:</p>

<pre><code>
sass your-project/styles.scss your-project/css/styles.css
</pre></code>

<p>There are many other options for compiling that you can find in the  [Sass Documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html). You can also look into using a task runner like [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) or [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).</p>

<h2>Browser Support</h2>
<p>Scales uses <span class="inline-code">box-sizing: border-box;</span>, and <span class="inline-code">display: table-cell;</span>, neither of which are supported in IE7 and under. There are a few media queries, but they are an enhancement. Thus, Scales is only for IE9+ and any modern browser, but IE8 is also mostly covered.</p>



<h2>Pattern Library</h2>
<p>This repo includes an <span class="inline-code">index.html</span> file that serves are a basic pattern library for Scales. It shows all of the available base settings and patterns. This can be used as a reference or styled into a more complete pattern library with your project's patterns as well.</p>
