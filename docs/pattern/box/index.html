<h2>Other uses</h2>
<p>Since there are times when you want any element to be boxed off, possibly with different amounts of padding at different breakpoints, the box pattern is also able to be used as a mixin. Simply pass in the padding value you want to use.</p>

<pre><code>
  @include box($padding);
</code></pre>
